<p align="justify">Suddenly, you realize that your cycle of true friendships is smaller than you imagined, and the most of them are the same people you kept from your childhood, because how more we grow older, it's hardest to trust in someone.</p>

<p align="justify">You look to the side and see that the people who passed in your life are already married, working, with the family constituted... They took other paths! And all of them for far away from you...</p>

<p align="justify">When someone ask you about have children, the first thing that comes to your mind is that you don't even have pacience to care about yourself, so you will have even less pacience to care about a child. You ask yourself, "How can I be over 20 and still have pimples?". You look at the mirror, realize that the time has passed and that your appearance has changed. Not much... However, sometimes it will seem that yes.</p>

<p align="justify">The weight of what you still need is very important. It becomes difficult to organize the time for your friends ("Let's date out a day of these?"). Work, college, dating... The crowds seem increasingly boring to you and your room more and more comforting. You realize that all the trips you planned, are not yet done... And you still be happy when you found some coins in the pockets of your pants!</p>

<p align="justify">A thousand of questions and few certainties... But, at the end of everything, you realize you are still yourself... Better than you was a day and much smaller than you will be tomorrow!</p>
