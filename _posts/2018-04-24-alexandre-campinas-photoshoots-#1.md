<p align="justify">This is something that I was thinking for a long time and it's something that I always want to try. As I have some ideas and ambitions in fashion area, and I always loved photography, I decided to do some photoshoots in studio... (Because it was too much cold outside!!! üòÖ)</p>

<p align="justify">I'm starting a blogger lifestyle, so I needed some photos to publish in my social networks' pages. The first step was to choose the clothes for the photoshoots. For me that was too easy because I'm so interested in fashion world and I'm always aware to the new trendings and looks!</p>

<p align="justify">The second step was to choose if the photosession would be made in the exterior or in the studio. I choose to do it in the studio, because as the main idea it's to advertise some fashion brands and styles, and currently, it's taking place the spring season (and it was cold and raining that day), I decided to use their Spring collections in the studio.</p>

<p align="justify">During the photosession, it was little difficult to me because it was my first time and initially, I didn't feel so confortable posing in the front of the camera. But was told me to relax and don't think too much about that. So I tried to keep calm, relaxed and to be most natural possible for the camera's len.</p>

<p align="justify">As the camera shoots some flashes, I'm started to gain some self confidence, enjoying each posing that I was making and everything starts to go fine. The final results are awesome and I loved too much the experience. For me was my first photosession and modeling experience, but don't will be the last, for sure! And for some of you, that want to start some project in the modeling area, I advise you to try it, You wouldn't regret, trust me!</p>

<p align="justify">The final results of the photossession are the following:</p>
