Hi everyone! I'm here to share some creative ideas to the loving ones celebrate the Valentine's Day in an original way! ðŸ˜Š

The Valentine's Day it's a desirable day for the most of the couples, to celebrate and tell to the loved soulmate how important are in their lives (Although, I think that Valentine's Day should be every day...)! ðŸ¤”

And in important dates in a life of a couple, some people don't know what to offer to their pairs. But, remember, sometimes the smallest gifts are the most rewarding. After all, the details make the difference! ðŸ˜‰

## `let` Declarations

However, we can now create declarations that are bound to any block, called (unsurprisingly) *block scoping*. This means all we need is a pair of `{ .. }` to create a scope. Instead of using var, which always declares variables attached to the enclosing function (or global, if top level) scope, use `let`:

{% highlight js %}
var a = 2;

{
    let a = 3;
    console.log( a );   // 3
}

console.log( a );       // 2
{% endhighlight %}
