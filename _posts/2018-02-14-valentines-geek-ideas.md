Hi everyone! ðŸ˜Š
The Valentine's Day it's a desirable day for the most of the couples, to celebrate and tell to the loved soulmate how important are in their lives (Although, I think that Valentine's Day should be every day...)! ðŸ¤”

And in important dates in a life of a couple, some people don't know what to offer to their pairs. But, remember, sometimes the smallest gifts are the most rewarding. After all, the details make the difference! ðŸ˜‰

If you've already read all those titles and you feel pretty comfortable with the topics they cover, it's time we dive into the evolution of JS to explore all the changes coming not only soon but farther over the horizon.

## `let` Declarations

However, we can now create declarations that are bound to any block, called (unsurprisingly) *block scoping*. This means all we need is a pair of `{ .. }` to create a scope. Instead of using var, which always declares variables attached to the enclosing function (or global, if top level) scope, use `let`:

{% highlight js %}
var a = 2;

{
    let a = 3;
    console.log( a );   // 3
}

console.log( a );       // 2
{% endhighlight %}
