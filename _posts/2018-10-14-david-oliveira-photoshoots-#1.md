<p align="justify">Hello one more time! I'm here to share with you, my <a href="../photoshoots/2018-09-17-david-oliveira-photoshoots-01/highlights.html"><i><u>2nd studio photoshoots</u></i></a>. This time, because it's summer, I decided to make it outside/outdoor, with some landscapes of Porto city as background! üòç</p>

<!--
<p align="justify">This is something that I was thinking for a long time and it's something that I always want to try. As I have some ideas and ambitions in fashion area, and I always loved <i><u>photography</u></i>, I decided to do some photoshoots in a studio... (<i><u>Because it was too much cold outside!!!</u></i> üòÖ)</p>-->

<!--<p align="justify"><i><u>I'm starting a blogger and fashion advisor lifestyle</u></i>, so I need some photos to publish in my <i><u>social networks and personal pages</u></i>. The first step was to choose the clothes for the photoshoots. For me that was too easy because <i><u>I'm so interested in fashion world and I'm always aware to the new trendings and looks!</u></i> I decided to bring 5 changes of clothes, to the studio, for this first photosession.</p>-->

<!--
<p align="justify">The second step was to choose if the photosession would be made in the exterior or in the studio. I choose to do it in the studio, because as the main idea it's to advertise some fashion brands, trendings and styles. And how, currently, it's taking place the spring season (<i><u>And it was cold in that week and was raining that day...</u></i> üò£), I decided to use their <b><i>Spring Collections</i></b> in the studio.</p>-->

<!--
<p align="justify">During the photosession, it was little difficult to me, because it was my first time and initially, I didn't feel so comfortable (<i><u>And perhaps, little shy</u></i>) posing in the front of the camera. But was told me to relax and don't think too much about that. <i><u>So I tried to keep calm, relaxed and pretend to be the most natural possible for the camera's len.</u></i></p>-->

<!--
<p align="justify">As the camera shoots some flashes, I'm started to gain some self confidence, enjoying each posing that I was making and everything starts to go fine. <i><u>The final results are awesome and I loved too much the experience.</u></i> For me was <i><u>my first photosession and modeling experience</u></i>, but don't will be the last, for sure! And for some of you, that want to start some project in the modeling area or simply want to do something new, just by curiosity, <i><u>I advise you to try it, you wouldn't regret, trust me!</u></i></p>-->

<p align="justify"><b>The highlights of the photosession are the following, resulting in a total of 284 photos without any edition:</b></p>-->
