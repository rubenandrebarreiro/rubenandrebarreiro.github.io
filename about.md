My name is R√∫ben Andr√© Barreiro! I'm 25 years old. I was born in Lisbon, Portugal. But I am currently living in Almada, Portugal.

I'm studying a BSc in Computer Science and Engineering at the Faculdade de Ci√™ncias e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (FCT NOVA), where I also done a scholarship research and development project, in Hyrax Project, representing NOVA-LINCS (Departamento de Inform√°tica da Nova's Labs). This project, had also the colaboration of Faculdade de Ci√™ncias da Universidade do Porto (INESC TEC/CRACS) and Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Science School.

<!--I am a tech enthusiast! I absolutely love to program - and most computer-related topics.
I like to solve puzzles and riddles. I also play the piano every once in a while.
I am still learning how to cook exquisite dishes though‚Ä¶-->
